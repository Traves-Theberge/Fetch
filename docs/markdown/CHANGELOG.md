## [3.2.1] - 2026-02-05 (Runtime Fixes, Security Hardening & Dead Code Purge 🔒)

### 🔴 Runtime Crash Fixes (P0)
- **Session Store DDL:** Fixed `conversation_threads` table column mismatch vs prepared statements. Added missing `meta` table DDL. Removed dead `memory_facts`/`working_context` tables.
- **Harness Executor:** `sendInput()` and `kill()` rewired through pool/spawner (were reading from unpopulated Map).
- **Task Respond:** Actually delivers user response to harness via `executor.sendInput()` (was a TODO).
- **Env Validation:** Moved before subsystem init so missing API keys fail fast.

### 🔒 Security Hardening (P1)
- Shell injection fixed in custom tools (shell-escaped params), workspace manager (name validation + heredocs), command parser (SHA validation + `execFile`).
- `/api/logout` now requires bearer token authentication.
- Removed backtick pattern from input validator that blocked inline code.

### 🧹 Dead Code Purge (~880 lines removed)
- `whatsapp-format.ts`: 628 → 96 lines (8 dead exports removed)
- `harness/executor.ts`: 596 → 403 lines (dead `spawnAndWait`, `getOutputBuffer`)
- Misc: unused logger bg colors, `box()`, `MEMORY_DIR`

### 📦 Infrastructure
- Added test scripts to package.json (`test`, `test:run`, `test:unit`, `test:e2e`, `test:integration`)
- Added `sendInput()` to `HarnessSpawner` and `HarnessPool`

## [3.2.0] - 2026-02-05 (Identity & Skills Pipeline Unification 🧬)

### 🧬 Unified Identity Pipeline
- **Single Source of Truth:** `IdentityManager.buildSystemPrompt()` is now the only system prompt builder. Deleted static prompt constants and 5 dead prompt functions from `agent/prompts.ts` — 418 lines removed.
- **Session Context Wired:** `buildContextSection()` now injected into both conversation and tool code paths.

### 🧩 Skill Discovery → Activation Pattern
- **Two-Phase Skills:** `<available_skills>` for discovery, `<activated_skill>` with full instruction body for activation.
- **`<location>` Field:** Skill summaries now include source path, following AgentSkills spec.

### 🐺 Pack Agent Sub-Files
- **Individual Profiles:** `data/identity/AGENTS.md` → `data/agents/{claude,gemini,copilot}.md` with YAML frontmatter.
- **`PackMember` Interface:** 13-field structured type with `<available_agents>` XML in system prompt.
- **Hot-Reload:** Watches both `data/identity/` and `data/agents/`.

### 🧹 Legacy Cleanup
- Removed dead code, updated JSDoc, fixed all broken tests (109/109 pass).
- Deprecated `data/identity/AGENTS.md` with migration header.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-02-05 (Code Audit & State Architecture 🧹)

### 🧹 Comprehensive Code Audit
- **20 dead files removed:** Entire `memory/` module (3 files), `retrieval/` module (6 files), `executor/docker.ts`, `utils/stream.ts`, `utils/sanitize.ts`, `tools/types.ts` (rebuilt), 7 dead barrel `index.ts` files, and empty `executor/` directory.
- **Dead code cleaned from live files:** Removed unused `cron_jobs` table DDL from `task/store.ts`, 10 dead exports from `utils/id.ts`, 6 dead functions from `agent/format.ts`, dead `SessionSummary` and `Database` interfaces from `session/types.ts`.
- **`tools/types.ts` rebuilt:** Kept only `ToolResult` and `DangerLevel` (removed ~30 dead exports).

### 📐 State Management Architecture Doc
- Created `docs/markdown/STATE_MANAGEMENT.md` documenting all 22 stateful singletons across 6 layers.
- Mapped 9 SQLite tables across 2 databases, filesystem watchers, and in-memory stores.
- Catalogued 7 EventEmitter chains, 3 singleton patterns, and initialization order.
- Identified 5 redundancies: dual task tracking, two ThreadManagers, dead cron_jobs table, dual process maps, mode naming collision.

### 📝 Documentation
- Updated `CODE_AUDIT_CHECKLIST.md` — all deleted/cleaned files annotated.
- Added State Management link to docs site sidebar.
- Updated README.md — fixed project structure, removed dead module references, corrected V2→V3 terminology.
- Synced root and docs CHANGELOGs to parity.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-02-05 (The Responsive Orchestrator)

### 🎭 Dynamic Identity System
- **Filesystem Hot-Reloading:** Fetch's personality is now fully customizable via Markdown files in `data/identity/`.
- **Live Updates:** Editing `SYSTEM.md` (Core rules) or `USER.md` (User info) instantly updates the system prompt without a restart.
- **New Commands:** `/identity reset` and `/identity <section>` to manage the agent's persona on the fly.

### 🧠 Runtime Skill Teaching
- **Dynamic Skills:** Skills (in `data/skills/`) are now hot-reloaded. You can "teach" Fetch new capabilities by dropping a Markdown file.
- **Skill Management:** Added `/skill` command suite to list, enable, disable, and manage skills at runtime.

### 💾 Robust Persistence & Recovery
- **Crash Recovery:** Fetch now persists its exact state (WORKING, WAITING, etc.) to the database.
- **Resurrection:** If the server crashes during a task, Fetch wakes up, checks the DB, restores the state, and resumes work (or alerts the user).
- **Thread Management:** Introduction of `/thread` commands for switching contexts and manually archiving conversations.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-02-04 (The Orchestrator Architecture)

### 🏗️ Core Architecture Overhaul
- **Orchestrator Philosophy:** Re-architected Fetch to be an *orchestrator* of specialized "sub-agents" (Claude, Gemini, Copilot) rather than just a chatbot.
- **New Mode System:** Introduced formal state machine modes: `ALERT` (Listening), `WORKING` (Executing), `WAITING` (Input), `GUARDING` (Safety), `RESTING` (Idle).
- **Instincts Layer:** Deterministic "fast-path" reactions that bypass the LLM for immediate control (e.g., `stop`, `status`).

### 🛡️ Safety
- **Safety Mode:** High-risk operations (file deletion, large refactors) now trigger a `GUARDING` mode that locks the context until approved.
- **Impact Analysis:** (Beta) Pre-execution diff reviews for critical changes.

### 🧩 Skills Framework
- **Modular Capabilities:** Created a plugin-like system for "Skills" (Git, Docker, React, etc.) defined in Markdown files.
- **Auto-Loading:** Skills are automatically discovered and loaded on startup.

## [2.4.4] - 2026-02-04 (Stability & Voice Fix 🎙️)

### 🔧 Bug Fixes

#### Message Deduplication
- Fixed **triple message response** bug where WhatsApp's `message_create` event fired multiple times
- Added `MessageDeduplicator` class with 30-second TTL to prevent duplicate processing
- Messages are now tracked by ID and processed exactly once

#### Voice Transcription (Local Whisper)
- Fixed **whisper binary path** mismatch in Dockerfile (`whisper-cli` → `whisper-cpp`)
- Voice notes now transcribe correctly using local `whisper.cpp` (100% free, no API)
- Added proper binary permissions and verification logging

#### Help & Capabilities
- Updated `CAPABILITIES` prompt to include all slash commands and aliases
- Now shows consistent information when asking "what can you do" or "what commands do you have"
- Commands now show aliases (e.g., `/status` shows `/st`, `/gs`)

### 📝 Changed Files
- `bridge/client.ts` - Added MessageDeduplicator for event deduplication
- `agent/prompts.ts` - Rewrote CAPABILITIES to include all commands
- `Dockerfile` - Fixed whisper binary copy command

## [2.4.3] - 2026-02-04 (Zero Trust Bonding 🔐)

### 🔐 Phone Number Whitelist (Issue #13)
- Implemented **Zero Trust Bonding** security model for group chat access control.
- Created `WhitelistStore` class for managing trusted phone numbers with file persistence.
- Added `/trust` commands for owner to manage whitelist via WhatsApp:
  - `/trust add <number>` - Add a phone number to the whitelist
  - `/trust remove <number>` - Remove a phone number from the whitelist
  - `/trust list` - Show all trusted numbers
  - `/trust clear` - Clear all trusted numbers (dangerous!)
- Added `TRUSTED_PHONE_NUMBERS` environment variable for startup configuration.
- Updated TUI config editor to include trusted numbers field.
- Owner is always exempt from whitelist checks (cannot be locked out).
- Unauthorized `@fetch` messages are silently dropped (no information leakage).

### 🛡️ Security Flow
```
Incoming @fetch message
    ↓
Is sender the owner? → Yes → ALLOW
    ↓ No
Is sender in whitelist? → Yes → ALLOW
    ↓ No
DROP (silent)
```

## [2.4.2] - 2026-02-04 (Repo Maps & Media Intelligence 🗺️👀)

### 🗺️ Smart Repo Maps (Issue #9)
- Implemented **Repository Mapping** to give the agent architectural awareness of large projects.
- Added `repo-map.ts` to generate a tree-based summary of the workspace, including symbols (classes, functions, exports).
- Added `symbols.ts` for regex-based symbol extraction for TypeScript, Python, and Go.
- Maps are automatically cached in session storage and refreshed if older than 5 minutes.
- The agent now understands project structure *before* taking action, reducing "blind" file searches.

### 🎙️ Voice & Vision (Issues #6 & #7)
- **Voice Notes:** Built-in Whisper integration automatically transcribes voice notes and PTT into text commands.
- **Image Intelligence:** Send screenshots or diagrams! Fetch now uses OpenAI Vision to analyze images and provide context (e.g., "Fix this error" + screenshot).
- Added multimedia support to the WhatsApp Bridge, allowing seamlessly mixing voice, text, and images.

### 🌊 Live Progress Streaming (Issue #8)
- Added real-time feedback for long-running tasks.
- Fetch now streams progress updates (e.g., "📝 Editing file...", "🧪 Running tests...") directly to WhatsApp.
- Implemented intelligent throttling to prevent message spans.

### 🔧 Core Improvements
- **Unified Command Parser:** Consolidated all slash command logic (`/status`, `/select`, etc.) into a single robust parser.
- **Session Sync:** Fixed state synchronization issues where agent-initiated workspace changes weren't persisting.
- **Self-Healing:** The agent now detects and automatically recovers from 429 Rate Limits and 500 errors.

- Cleaned up Go TUI diagnostics and optimized QR code rendering logic.

### 🧹 Code Quality
- Migrated to Flat Config (`eslint.config.js`) for ESLint 9 compatibility.
- Fixed useless regex escape characters and unused variable warnings.
- Achieved 100% test pass rate (104/104 tests) across Unit, E2E, and Integration suites.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-02-04 (Reliability & Persistence 🔄 💾)

### 🔄 Better Error Recovery & Retry Logic
- Implemented robust retry strategy with backoffs [0s, 1s, 3s, 10s].
- Added user-facing progress reporting during retries ("Hold on, fetching again... 🐕").
- Added specialized handling for `400 Bad Request`, retrying once with simplified context history.
- Consolidated all LLM calls (conversation, tools, task framing) into a unified retry handler.

### 💾 Persistent Task Management
- Created SQLite-based `TaskStore` for reliable task state preservation.
- Implemented automatic state loading on application startup.
- Ensured all task transitions and progress updates are persisted in real-time.
- Synchronized `TaskQueue` with stored active tasks to prevent data loss across restarts.

- `rust`: Scaffolds using `cargo init`
- `go`: Scaffolds using `go mod init` and creates a sample `main.go`
- `react`: Scaffolds a React app using Vite (`npm create vite@latest`)
- `next`: Scaffolds a Next.js app using `create-next-app` (non-interactive)

**Features:**
- Real-time progress events for workspace scaffolding
- Generous timeouts for heavy scaffolders (Next.js, Vite)
- Automatic git initialization for all scaffolded projects

### Changed

**Kennel Container:**
- Updated `kennel/Dockerfile` to include essential runtimes:
