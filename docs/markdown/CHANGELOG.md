## [Unreleased]

### Added

#### 🧠 4-Mode Architecture

#### 🎯 Intent Classification
- Automatic intent detection based on message patterns
- Routes to appropriate mode without user intervention
- Pattern matching for greetings, inquiries, actions, and tasks

#### 📁 Project Management
- `/projects` - List all git repositories in workspace
- `/project <name>` - Switch active project context
- `/clone <url>` - Clone repositories into workspace
- `/init <name>` - Initialize new projects
- `/status` - Git status (moved from general status)
- `/diff` - Show current changes
- `/log [n]` - Show recent commits

#### 📱 WhatsApp-Friendly Formatting
- `formatForWhatsApp()` - Mobile-optimized output
- Compact diff display with emoji indicators (🟢/🔴)
- Truncation for long outputs
- Error messages with suggested fixes

#### 🏗️ New Source Files
- `agent/intent.ts` - Intent classifier with pattern matching
- `agent/conversation.ts` - Conversation mode handler
- `agent/inquiry.ts` - Inquiry mode with read-only tools
- `agent/action.ts` - Single-edit action handler
- `agent/prompts.ts` - Centralized system prompt builders
- `agent/whatsapp-format.ts` - Mobile formatting utilities
- `session/project.ts` - Project scanner and context

### Changed

- **System Prompts** - Centralized in `prompts.ts` for consistency
- **Help Text** - Updated with new commands and mode explanations
- **Session Type** - Added `currentProject` and `availableProjects`
- `/status` command now shows git status (use `/task` for task status)
